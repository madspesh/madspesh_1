		  			<h3>Brief</h3>
				  	<p>The client was in need of some help with branding and art direction in order to visually align their product range cohesively and make the website look distinctively theirs.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>They wanted to be able to edit content and add new snacks to their product range quickly and easily using a custom built content management system. A store locator, customer contact hub and search mechanism were also required.</p>
				</div>

		  		<div class="image_description">
		  			<h3>Outcome</h3>
				  	<p>I took the lead on the redesign, liaising directly with the client and dev team in an agile working environment. The fully-responsive site contains 10+ pages including a media centre, article listings and product detail pages, all modifiable client-side using django CMS.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>The new art direction takes a flat design approach using bright colours and vector illustrations to bring the products to life. I created custom UI elements including hand-drawn icons and 3D multi-state buttons.</p>

		  		<div class="image_description">
		  			<h3>Header Carousel</h3>
				  	<p>On site load, the only content above the fold is a full-screen image carousel, rotating vector illustrations of anthropomorphic products on top of a static ‚Äòrolling hills‚Äô background.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>Clicking the explore button anchors the user down to the snack catalogue panel below, from which users can navigate into the product detail page of each snack. The full range is also shown in the nav bar‚Äôs ‚ÄòOur products‚Äô drop down menu.</p>

		  		<div class="image_description">
		  			<h3>Nutritional Filters</h3>
				  	<p>The ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs a Better-for-you snack?‚Äù panel allows users to filter products by nutritional need, such as gluten-free, cholesterol-free and kosher. Each option contains a brief description, store locator and shop online CTA‚Äôs, as well as a link to view those specific products.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>Clicking ‚ÄòSee all non-GMO products‚Äù, for example, will use the site‚Äôs search engine to display a list of GMO free snacks. The search mechanism not only looks at product keywords, but also articles from the media centre.</p>

		  		<div class="image_description">
		  			<h3>Subscription Form</h3>
				  	<p>Towards the bottom, the homepage again provides links to shop online at Sensible Portions‚Äô Amazon store, and to find a nearby stockist using a Destini store locator plugin.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>The final section above the footer allows users to subscribe to the brand‚Äôs mailing list, using a simple sign up form embedded within the panel.</p>

				<div class="image_description">
		  			<h3>Product Details</h3>
				  	<p>Clicking a product from the homepage, nav menu or search results page activates the product detail page. This page is illustrated in a similar vector style to the homepage, embedding the product within an image of a cloud floating above the rolling hills background.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>The user is able to scroll through different sizes and flavours of that particular product, with the pack image changing on click as a subtle confirmation that the user‚Äôs request has been registered.</p>

		  			<h3>Responsive Layout</h3>
				  	<p>Other pages on the site include a Media Centre hub, a Contact Us page with a short form embedded, an FAQ page with expandable drawers, and an About Us page.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>The rolling hills background of the site is fixed, and crops to accommodate various different viewports. The actual content of the site adapts to changing breakpoints using Bootstrap‚Äôs responsive grid system.</p>

			  	<div class="image_description">
		  			<h3>Custom UI Elements</h3>
				  	<p>All of the icons on the site are custom designed, right down to the arrows on the carousels. I tried to give the nutritional icons a hand-drawn aesthetic by using diagonal gradients and rugged lines.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>I created 3D multi-state buttons for the primary CTA‚Äôs, with a simpler outlined style for the secondary CTA‚Äôs. This fun illustrative style of UI works well with the youthful art direction of the site.</p>

	   		  	<div class="image_description">
		  			<h3>Design Guide</h3>
				  	<p>Working directly alongside the dev team helped when compiling an initial style guide. The site uses a mix of flat and 3D styled buttons in a variety of colours with several different states, so it was important to be specific about how everything was designed to look and function.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>I exported and optimised all assets including icons, backgrounds and imagery, and used Zeplin to communicate any design changes from the client.</p>

		  			<h3>Reflections</h3>
				  	<p>Under my art director‚Äôs supervision, this was my first project in which I was the sole designer from inception to production. The build process was a steep learning curve and I discovered a lot about what is and isn‚Äôt possible in web development.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>The CMS we built upon was unable to accept SVG so the speed of the site was compromised by large background images and button states. However the client was happy with what we produced and the redesign has stood the test of time. You can view the site here.</p>
