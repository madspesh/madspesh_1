	  			<h3>Overview</h3>
			  	<p>Action Time is an app which helps you dedicate time in your schedule, whether it be an hour a month or 12 hours a week, towards supporting the causes you care about.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>It was developed as the result of a mock inception for <a class="link_dotted_dark" target="_blank" href="https://speakable.org/">Speakable</a>, a social action company using technology to enable smart and effective civic engagement.</p>

			</div>


	  		<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Discovery</h3>
			  	<p>We began by interviewing our clients Jordan Hewson and Robert Walport of Speakable, who gave us an overview of the company, their audience, and their first digital product, <a class="link_dotted_dark" target="_blank" href="https://actionbutton.org/">Action Button</a>.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>I began conducting my own desktop research and thinking about future product opportunities for one of Speakableâ€™s main user types.</p>
			</div>

		  	</div>


	  		<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Sprint</h3>
			  	<p>We used IDEO brainstorming methods to create our Value Proposition Canvas, which helped us identify a number of pains and gains for the Speakable users five primary jobs; volunteering, attending events, voting, donating and contacting representatives.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>After various sprint exercises, my team settled on one main challenge; How can we encourage people to spend more time volunteering and donating to causes they are interested in?</p>
			</div>
		  	<div class="image_padding">

		  	</div>


	  		<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Field Research</h3>
			  	<p>In order to assess our initial user assumptions we needed to do some quantative research, so we conducted lean interviews with two users who had volunteered and donated in the past; Aggie and Shiloh.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>Our post-interview synthesis revealed a common want for personalised content and a stronger interest in local vs. national/global causes. This empathy map I designed for Aggie illustrates her issues with finding volunteering opportunities in her specific area.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image_padding">

		  	</div>


	  		<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>User Personas</h3>
			  	<p>I created a persona graphic for Shiloh in order to better represent the insights and findings from our user interviews.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>Shilohâ€™s persona represents a common type of user who is passionate about specific issues and causes, but short on time due to work and family commitments.</p>
			</div>

	  		<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Understanding</h3>
			  	<p>Through our research we came to the understanding that time constraints and personalised content were the main issues we wanted to address, so we began to sketch out a low fidelity process map for our entire app.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>As the strategy of our ideation was quite complex, we each decided to focus on one specific feature. I worked on the onboarding, data collection and personalised dashboard sections highlighted here.</p>
			</div>
		  	<div class="image_padding">
		  		<img src="./style/img/actiontime_userflow_lowfidelity.jpg" alt="Process Map Sketch">
		  	</div>


	  		<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Wireframing</h3>
			  	<p>I began to draw low fidelity wireframes of my key screens in order to illustrate the user flow of my specific feature.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>Sketching my ideas out on paper first allowed me to iterate quickly and easily without getting caught up in the specific details of visual fidelity.</p>
			</div>
		  	<div class="image_padding">
		  		<img src="./style/img/actiontime_wireframes_lowfidelity.jpg" alt="Low Fidelity Wireframes">
		  	</div>


			<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Wireframing</h3>
			  	<p>Next I brought my finalised user flow into Sketch, where I began to integrate further content and functionality into a set of high fidelity wireframes. Here are four of my key screens which show:</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>1. The onboarding introduction to the app</p>
			  	<p>2. The option to personalise content by selecting issues youâ€™re interested in</p>
			  	<p>3. The option to dedicate time per week/month to making a change</p>
			  	<p>4. A personalised feed of opportunities filtered to your specific interests and time constraints</p>
			</div>

		  	</div>


		  	<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Prototyping</h3>
			  	<p>I then created <a class="link_dotted_dark" target="_blank" href="http://invis.io/PHOF4G6587Q/">this clickable</a> of my user flow using InVision. The prototype illustrates additional features such as the option to localise content to either your current city or an area of your choice.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>From your personalised dashboard you are also able to filter opportunities by cause, sort opportunities by time, and separate your feed into volunteering or donating opportunities only.</p>

		  	<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Moodboards</h3>
			  	<p>The final stages of the project were spent developing the user interface of our app, and we each created our own individual designs. I produced these style tiles of Speakableâ€™s current UI and my own UI suggestions for Action Time.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>I tried to maintain consistency by reusing the pink and blue colour palette and signature sans-serif font 'GT Walsheim', but I also introduced a secondary teal shade and an additional serif font â€˜Loraâ€™.</p>
			</div>
		  	<div class="image_padding">
		  		<img src="./style/img/actiontime_UImoodboard.png" alt="Speakable and Action Time Moodboard">
		  	</div>


		  	<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Design Guide</h3>
			  	<p>My interface design guide for Action Time details all of the specific font weights and sizes used in the app. I also included the hex and RGB codes of the full five colour palette.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>I created text styles and symbols from my design guide and saved the document as a Sketch library, which made it easy to develop my finalised key screens.</p>
			</div>
		  	<div class="">
		  		<img src="./style/img/actiontime_styleguide_a.gif" alt="Colour and Typography">
		  	</div>


		  	<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Design Guide</h3>
			  	<p>I used icons instead of text labels to categorise Speakableâ€™s main issue areas such as womenâ€™s rights, environment and politics. Some issues such as migration and poverty were quite tricky to illustrate sensitively, so I decided to take a more abstract approach.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>I also created illustrations for the appâ€™s initial onboarding screens to visualise three mantras from Action Time's elevator pitch; â€˜Pick your passionsâ€™, â€˜Prioritize your timeâ€™ and â€˜Make a differenceâ€™.</p>
			</div>
		  	<div class="">
		  		<img src="./style/img/actiontime_styleguide_b.gif" alt="Icons and Imagery">
		  	</div>


		  	<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Design Guide</h3>
			  	<p>Also included in the design guide are various UI elements and components such as buttons, inputs, forms and menus.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>One element I used consistently as a visual cue for user interaction was the solid pink line, which serves as both the baseline for a text input field as well as the track for a range input slider.</p>
			</div>

		  	<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Reflections</h3>
			  	<p>Insights gained from our user interviews proved many of our initial theories about Speakableâ€™s audience wrong, particularly the assumed importance of attending events and protests. This demonstrates the value of UX research when forming a product vision.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>For future iterations I would like to incorporate more meaningful microinteractions into my design. Speakable were happy with the outcome of our mock inception and I am now working with them directly on more projects.</p>
