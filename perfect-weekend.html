	  			<h3>Overview</h3>
			  	<p>My Perfect FT Weekend is a responsive website which allowed users to upload a video, image or text depiction of their ideal weekend, with the chance of actually winning the experience they described.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>This annual competition is run by FT Weekend, a supplement to the weekly edition of the Financial Times newspaper. Our challenge was to design and build a microsite to receive, house and display all of the competition entries.</p>

	  			<h3>Brief</h3>
			  	<p>With an ever-growing number of newspapers making strides in the digital landscape, FT Weekend were looking to expand their online presence amongst a younger, social media savvy audience.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>The main functions of the site were to allow users to submit their entry, share via social media, explore other user entries and vote for their favourite. Unlike previous years, we wanted to accomodate videos and images in addition to text to make the site more visually engaging.</p>
			</div>

   		  	</div>


	  		<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Outcome</h3>
			  	<p>Going beyond the initial brief, we essentially created a mini social network built almost solely out of user generated content, intertwined with beautiful imagery and relevant articles from FT.com for inspiration.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>The country side highlights hotel prices and percentage rises/falls of the overall country, but the desktop version also incorporates a map which users can hover over to explore other cities in that country. On mobile, the map is simplified to a dropdown menu.</p>

	  			<h3>Entry Process</h3>
			  	<p>To enter the competition we asked users to summarise their perfect FT Weekend in 140 characters or less, which allowed entries to be easily shared within Twitter and Facebook's character limit.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>Subtle transitions throughout the entry process made the experience more delightful for the user, and each entry question was isolated and displayed within the same section of the page, eliminating any unnecessary scrolling.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="">
				<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" class="video_1">
            		<source src="./style/img/perfectweekend_entryprocess.mp4" type="video/mp4">

   		  	</div>


	  		<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>User Generated Content</h3>
			  	<p>Once users had written their description, they could opt to add a photo, video or Snapchat/Instagram story to their entry. We encouraged entrants to experiment with filters, stickers and lenses to make their imagery more dynamic.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>Uploading content took seconds thanks to a considered file size limit, and all visuals were stored on the server ready for our review. Once approved, entries could be viewed and voted for directly within a submissions grid.</p>
			</div>

				<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" class="video_1">

   		  	</div>


	  		<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Entry Submission</h3>
			  	<p>After all steps had been completed, users had the chance to review their entry and edit if needed. Clicking submit activated a pop-up window alerting the user that their entry was under consideration, and they then received regular emails on the status of their submission.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>Users could then either log out of their account, edit their account details (such as the email address, username and password they signed up with) or continue exploring the site and viewing/voting for other entries.</p>
			</div>
		  	<div class="">
				<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" class="video_1">

   		  	</div>


			<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Above The Fold</h3>
			  	<p>One of the most distinctive features of the site was the unique header carousel, which rotated carefully selected visuals relating to the Life, Arts and Culture sectors of the FT Weekend brand.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>On hover/click, the images inside each individual container would change according to the category selected.</p>
			</div>
		  	<div class="">
				<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" class="video_1">
            		<source src="./style/img/perfectweekend_header.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          			Your browser does not support the video tag.
          		</video>
   		  	</div>


		  	<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Page Layout</h3>
			  	<p>As the header, entry process and submissions grid were all integrated into one page, we wanted to ensure that secondary information (terms and conditions, privacy policies, etc.) wouldn‚Äôt distract from the more important elements of the site.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>This hidden ‚ÄòLearn More‚Äô panel with details of the competition doesn‚Äôt take up prime real estate, but it has a clear CTA button inviting user interaction.</p>
			</div>
		  	<div class="">
		  		<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" class="video_1">
            		<source src="./style/img/perfectweekend_learnmore.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          			Your browser does not support the video tag.
          		</video>
		  	</div>


		  	<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Voting Process</h3>
			  	<p>Another interesting part of the UX was the site‚Äôs unique voting system. Users were able to vote directly from the submissions grid, or click on an entry box to view its full description, to vote for the entry, and to share it on social media.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>The vote button had a number of conditions, including a call to action state (‚ÄúVote‚Äù), a post-action state (‚ÄúVoted!"), and a number of votes state (eg. ‚Äú24‚Äù with a thumbs-up icon). This provided users with a visual acknowledgement that their vote was registered.</p>

		  	<div class="image_description">
	  			<h3>Design Guide</h3>
			  	<p>Working with such a large and well branded publication, it was really important that the design language we created for the website closely adhered to the Financial Times‚Äô own digital guidelines.</p>
			  	<hr>
			  	<p>An intensive style guide was developed throughout the design process for our developer to reference, and it was continuously updated following feedback from the client and during the user testing stage.</p>
