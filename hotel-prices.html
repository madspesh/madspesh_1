		  			<h3>Overview</h3>
				  	<p>Hotel Prices Around the World is an interactive application which can help you to make the most of your travel budget and provide inspiration for your next trip.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>It was developed as the result of a brief from Hotels.com, who wanted to create a graphic tool with a clear call to action that could be easily shared on social media to drive sales. Data was pulled from their Hotel Price Index site which houses information about hotel prices from over 30 popular destinations.</p>

		  		<div class="image_description">
		  			<h3>Challenge</h3>
				  	<p>Our challenge was to find a creative way of showcasing all of this information in a way that would engage rather than overwhelm the user. The product needed to be functional across all devices and able to be easily updated by the Hotels.com team.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>It also needed to be built and adapted for thirteen different countries, taking into account the varying data reports, language translations and currency exchange of each country.</p>
				</div>

		  		<div class="image_description">
		  			<h3>Interface</h3>
				  	<p>On page load, users are presented with a colour-coded key which they can use to filter cities by regions such as Asia, Europe and North America. A comparison toolbar allows users to weigh up the price differences between up to four cities. Cities are added to the toolbar by clicking the plus icon.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>Next to the plus icon is an expand symbol which activates each cityâ€™s individual data card. The city squares are organised by average hotel price, with the most expensive city being the first and largest square.</p>

	            		<source src="./style/img/hotelprices_desktop_scroll.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	          			Your browser does not support the video tag.
	          		</video>
	   		  	</div>


		  		<div class="image_description">
		  			<h3>Cards</h3>
				  	<p>The expanded city data cards are actually double-sided, with city info on one side and country info on the other. The city side features useful stats such as average hotel price, average prices by star rating, and annual percentage rises/falls.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>The country side highlights hotel prices and percentage rises/falls of the overall country, but the desktop version also incorporates a map which users can hover over to explore other cities in that country. On mobile, the map is simplified to a dropdown menu.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="">

	          			Your browser does not support the video tag.
	          		</video>
	   		  	</div>


		  		<div class="image_description">
		  			<h3>Compare</h3>
				  	<p>The comparison bar allows users to view their chosen city cards in a scrollable list format. Individual cards can be removed from the list by clicking the X icon. Additionally, users can flip to the country side of their cards whilst still in comparison mode, and use the map to continue exploring other cities.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>To start over, the user can delete cards one-by-one or click the trash icon to return to the barâ€™s original state. The bar is preloaded with empty segments so the user knows how many cities they can compare.</p>
				</div>

	          		</video>
	   		  	</div>


		  		<div class="image_description">
		  			<h3>Transitions</h3>
				  	<p>The data cards feature some interesting UI transitions; on desktop, the city side of the card swipes to the left and the country card slides in from the right, whilst on mobile the card literally flips over to reveal the country data on the other side.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>In comparison mode on mobile, we integrated a Tinder-style swiping transition which allows users to swipe left and right through their selection of cities, whilst still being able to flip cards over to view the country side if needed.</p>
				</div>
			  	<div class="">
					<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" class="video_1">
	            		<source src="./style/img/hotelprices_video_3.mp4" type="video/mp4">

	          		</video>
	   		  	</div>


		  		<div class="image_description">
		  			<h3>Interactions</h3>
				  	<p>The comparison bar also uses sliding and fading transitions when adding cities, comparing and clearing the bar. These subtle animations help to enhance basic interactions and makes the user experience feel smoother.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>Classic bar charts were used to represent hotel price stats as well as more unusual visualisations, such as the circular graphic used for the â€˜average hotel price by star ratingâ€™ data.</p>
				</div>
			  	<div class="">

	            		<source src="./style/img/hotelprices_video_4.mp4" type="video/mp4">

	          		</video>
	   		  	</div>


				<div class="image_description">
		  			<h3>Design Guide</h3>
				  	<p>We selected five hues from the Hotels.com brand palette to create the regional colour-coded key. Each regionâ€™s colour is used boldly across the interactive, from the individual city squares to the data cards, in order to create an easily understood visual system.</p>
				  	<hr>
				  	<p>The city squares use a diagonal gradient to allow cities from the same region to sit next to each other without blending into one block. We adhered to brand guidelines by using Roboto as our chosen typeface, but we designed a unique icon set and vector maps for each city.</p>
